# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to interact with Excel files using natural language commands through a local large language model (LLM). The system will allow users to perform CRUD operations, query data, and create visualizations/plots within Excel files using conversational commands instead of traditional spreadsheet formulas or manual operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to create new data entries in my Excel file using natural language commands, so that I can add information without manually navigating cells and typing values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a natural language command to create data THEN the system SHALL parse the command and insert the specified data into the appropriate Excel cells
2. WHEN the system creates new data entries THEN it SHALL validate the data types match the existing column structure
3. WHEN data creation is successful THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of what was added and where
4. IF the specified location or column doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification or suggest creating new columns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to read and query data from my Excel file using natural language, so that I can quickly find information without writing complex formulas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question about data in the Excel file THEN the system SHALL interpret the query and return relevant results
2. WHEN performing queries THEN the system SHALL support filtering, sorting, and aggregation operations
3. WHEN query results are returned THEN the system SHALL present them in a clear, readable format
4. WHEN a query cannot be understood THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions to better understand the user's intent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data manager, I want to update existing data in my Excel file through natural language commands, so that I can modify information efficiently without manual cell editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to update specific data THEN the system SHALL locate the target cells and apply the requested changes
2. WHEN updating data THEN the system SHALL preserve data integrity and validate new values
3. WHEN updates are completed THEN the system SHALL confirm what changes were made
4. IF the system cannot uniquely identify the data to update THEN it SHALL request additional specificity from the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to delete data from my Excel file using natural language commands, so that I can remove outdated or incorrect information without manual selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to delete specific data THEN the system SHALL identify and remove the target entries
2. WHEN performing deletions THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before removing data
3. WHEN deletions are completed THEN the system SHALL report what was removed
4. IF the deletion request is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL seek clarification to avoid unintended data loss

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to create plots and visualizations from my Excel data using natural language commands, so that I can generate charts without manually configuring chart settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a plot or chart THEN the system SHALL analyze the data and create an appropriate visualization
2. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the system SHALL support common chart types (bar, line, pie, scatter, etc.)
3. WHEN plots are generated THEN they SHALL be embedded directly in the Excel file
4. WHEN chart specifications are unclear THEN the system SHALL suggest chart types based on the data characteristics
5. IF the requested data cannot be visualized THEN the system SHALL explain why and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to work with my local LLM, so that my data remains private and I don't depend on external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes commands THEN it SHALL use only local LLM resources
2. WHEN handling Excel files THEN all data SHALL remain on the local machine
3. WHEN the local LLM is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN connecting to the LLM THEN the system SHALL establish the connection efficiently without external dependencies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle various Excel file formats and structures, so that I can work with my existing spreadsheets regardless of their layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening Excel files THEN the system SHALL support common formats (.xlsx, .xls, .csv)
2. WHEN analyzing file structure THEN the system SHALL automatically detect headers, data types, and table boundaries
3. WHEN working with multiple sheets THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify which sheet to operate on
4. IF a file format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest compatible alternatives
